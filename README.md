# Sparkify: Data Modeling with Postgres

## Background

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on 
songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is
particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. 
Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a 
directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with
JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

I've been brought on as a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables 
designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. My role is to create a database 
schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.

## Project Description

In this project, I've applied what I've learned on data modeling with Postgres and 
built an ETL pipeline using Python. I've defined fact and dimension tables for a 
star schema, and wrote an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two 
local directories into tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Data

### Song Dataset
The song dataset is a subset of the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/),
which is a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million
contemporary popular music tracks. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata
about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three
letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in the dataset:
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like:
```
 {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
 ```

### Log Dataset
The log dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this 
[event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim), which is a program 
that generates event data for testing and demos. The log files are partitioned
by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset:
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like:

## Files and Usage

- ```sql_queries.py```: contains SQL queries to create, drop, and insert records into the tables

- ```create_tables.py```: runs the queries contained in ```sql_queries.py``` to drop and create
        the tables. Run this file to reset the tables.

- ```etl.py```: reads and processes files from ```song_data``` and ```log_data``` and loads them 
        into the tables.

- ```etl.ipynb```: reads and processes a single file from ```song_data``` and ```log_data``` and 
        loads the data into the tables. Used for development. This notebook contains detailed
        instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.

- ```test.ipynb```: displays the first few rows of each table to check the database.
